<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>Consider the following Java code snippet implementing the Builder pattern:
<pre><code class="java">public class Car {
    private final String engine;
    private final int wheels;

    private Car(Builder builder) {
        this.engine = builder.engine;
        this.wheels = builder.wheels;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String engine;
        private int wheels;

        public Builder setEngine(String engine) {
            this.engine = engine;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setWheels(int wheels) {
            this.wheels = wheels;
            return this;
        }

        public Car build() {
            return new Car(this);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
What benefits does this Builder pattern provide in the above implementation?
